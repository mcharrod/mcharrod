<p> I have always had a fascination with tech and it's ability to be used in many different ways. My dream is to use my skills and knowledge to leave a positive imprint to this world. I believe that one of the ways I can carry this out is by providing my skills towards greater accessability. Technology is a powerful tool that can be used to fill in the gaps between people's varying levels of ability. A task that somebody with a tremor might not be able to do with their hand can easily be done by a machine. These types of innovations are most exciting to me! While attending a conference one thing that struck me from the accessability team was their reflection on their process for building apps: you are not building one single app for everybody, but building several distinct apps optimized for several different kinds of people with different needs. <p>
