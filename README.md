<h1>Hi there, I'm Katy! </h1>

<p> I am a recent grad for the backend program for [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/). My pronouns are she/they. I have a fascination with tech and it's many different potential uses. My dream is to use my skills and knowledge to leave a positive imprint to this world. I believe that one of the ways I can carry this out is by providing my skills towards greater accessability. Technology is a powerful tool that can be used to fill in the gaps between people's varying levels of ability, and I want to be a part of that. I thrive in collaborative environments and I love getting my teammates to smile. <p>
