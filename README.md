<h1>Hi there, I'm Katy! </h1>

<p> I am a recent grad for the backend program for <a href="https://turing.edu/">Turing School of Software and Design</a>. My pronouns are she/they. I have a fascination with tech and it's ability to accommodate the needs of different minds and bodies. My dream is to use my skills and knowledge to leave a positive imprint to this world, and I believe that one of the ways I can carry this out is by using the power of technology and providing my skills towards greater accessability. I thrive in collaborative environments and I love getting my teammates to smile. <p>
