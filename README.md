<p> I have a fascination with tech and it's many different potential uses. My dream is to use my skills and knowledge to leave a positive imprint to this world. I believe that one of the ways I can carry this out is by providing my skills towards greater accessability. Technology is a powerful tool that can be used to fill in the gaps between people's varying levels of ability, and I want to be a part of that. <p>
